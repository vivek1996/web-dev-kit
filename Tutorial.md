# Tutorial

In This Short Tutorial We Will Build A Simple Project Using Web-Dev-Kit And Bootstrap For Styling.

+ ## Install Projects Files

    First We Will Install Web-Dev-Kit. To Do It We Have To Just Clone Or Download The Repo And Run `cd <project-folder> && npm install` (Replace `<project-folder>` With The Name Of The Folder You Project Is In) This Will Just Install All The Dependencies We Need For This Kit To Work.

    So Now If We Will Run `npm start` In Our Command Prompt (Terminal In Mac) It Will Start The Project In Your Browser.

    To Edit The Site Just Open Your Project In A Code Editor. I Recommend Using Visual Studio Code But Other Editors Like Atom And Sublime Text Are Also Good.

    You Will Find Two Files There `index.html` And `index.php` You Can Edit Any One Of Them And Delete The Other One But In This Tutorial I Am Going To Use `index.html` So I Will Delete `index.php`.

    So Now Its Time To Include Bootstrap In Our Project. I Am Going To Use A CDN But It Is As Per You If You Want To Use A CDN Or Download It.

+ ## Running Our App

    Now As We Installed All Things We Can Start Our App. So Open Your Terminal And Simply Run `npm start` In It.
